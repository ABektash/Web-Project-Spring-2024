                                Manchester United are the most successful club in England and have won 20 league titles,
                                which is more than any other team. They have also won 12 FA Cups and 3 European Cups.
                                The club started as Newton Heath L&YR F.C. in 1878.
                                All of the team worked at Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath.
                                After nearly closing in 1902, John Henry Davies took over and changed the club's name to
                                Manchester United F.C.. Manchester United made Matt Busby their manager after World War
                                II.
                                Matt Busby used the youth team to get new players, and this was very successful.
                                The club won the Football League in 1956 and 1957.
                                The success was stopped by the Munich air disaster in 1958, when eight of the club's
                                players
                                died.
                                It was thought that the club might close, but it did not. They won the Football League
                                in
                                1965 and 1967, and the European Cup in 1968.

                                                    was constructed to a capacity of 77,000.
                                                    In the Second World War, bombings damaged the stadium. While the
                                                    stadium

                                                    The stadium was converted to an all-seater stadium in 1993 for

                                                    North Stand raised the capacity to 55,000.
                                                    In the middle of 1999, the East and West Stands were expanded to
